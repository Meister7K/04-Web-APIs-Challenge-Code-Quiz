# 04-Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz

## Description
-My goal for this project was to create a fun yet challenging website quiz on Elden Ring. My goal was to understand web APIs and making useful transitions. In this project I learned how to create timers, loop through event listeners, record data in local storage, and output that data into a viewable section of the HTML file. 
I hope you enjoy reviewing and taking this quiz, tarnished. 

See comments at bottom of JS for approach.
